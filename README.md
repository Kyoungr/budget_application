## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am an Information Technology/Information Systems double major with a full time offer as a software engineer. The company I will be working for, along with many other companies use javascript for their front end languages. Building this web application allowed me to utilize my critial thinking skills and technical knowlege of software to build a simple but powerful web application. I also aspire to build my own website for my small business and this gave me the oppurtunity test out a possible frontend language.
